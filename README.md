# WiDS-2022-Camouflage-Object-Masking
This repository consists of everything I used to do the project, including the learning resources, my notes and my codes.
## Introduction
Camouflage Object Masking deals with the task of identifying and segmenting out objects that are not well-distinguished from their backgrounds. This is a specialized problem within the domain of Computer Vision, which has been seeing and continues to see rapid advances and novel techniques.<br>
Camouflage Object Masking has several applications across varied fields including medical image segementation, rare species discovery, the miliary, and so on. Recent work also suggests that research in AI-based segmentation of camouflaged objects could hold key insights into how the hierarchial levels of human visual perception are structured.<br>

## Details
The primary framework that is used is <b>PyTorch</b>. To run the code, download the Images and Masks folders from the repository. The paths used in the code are specifically for my PC. Please make changes in the code accordingly <br>

## Outputs
Observe the last 2 cells of the evaluation model code and make changes accordingly to control how many images you want to display and for how long
